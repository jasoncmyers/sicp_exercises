;Exercise 1.18.  Using the results of exercises 1.16 and 1.17, devise a procedure that generates an iterative process for multiplying two integers in terms of adding, doubling, and halving and uses a logarithmic number of steps.

; This seems the same as 1.17?
; I guess maybe 1.17 was supposed to be tree recursive?
